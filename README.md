# Survival Additions

This mod adds new tools, food, and blocks that are aiming to be kind of in-between vanilla-feel and the feel of mods like Terrafirmacraft. I want to make it possible to live in more biomes/dimensions and add useful new crafting recipes. I am currently not completely sure where to take this mod so I am looking for suggestions for features and feedback about the textures/art-style of the mod.
