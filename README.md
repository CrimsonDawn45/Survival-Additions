# THIS MOD IS NO LONGER BEING DEVLOPED!
I keep making promises to people to update this mod. I don't know why, I have completely burnt myself on minecraft and I don't want anything to do with it anytime soon. This mod is under an MIT License so if you want to use the pixel art for your mod or something I really don't care I just dont want to keep getting emailed/messaged about when the next update will be. Making mods was fun before the mod hit 100k downloads now it's just a chore to maintain and has made me kind of paranoid to open my github account bc I don't want people to see me working on something else instead of updating the mod. It was fun while it lasted, but I'm done modding.

# Survival Additions

This mod adds new tools, food, and blocks that are aiming to be kind of in-between vanilla-feel and the feel of mods like Terrafirmacraft. I want to make it possible to live in more biomes/dimensions and add useful new crafting recipes. I am currently not completely sure where to take this mod so I am looking for suggestions for features and feedback about the textures/art-style of the mod.
